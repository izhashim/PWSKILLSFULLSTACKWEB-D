/* 
In JavaScript, operators play a fundamental role in programming by enabling the manipulation and processing of data. Operators perform various operations on operands, which can be values or variables. The primary reasons operators are essential in programming include:

1.Arithmetic Operations:
Operators such as +, -, *, /, and % perform basic arithmetic operations. These operations are crucial for mathematical calculations in programs.

2.Comparison Operations:
Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=) allow the comparison of values, helping in decision-making and control flow within the program.

3.Logical Operations:
Logical operators (&&, ||, !) enable the formulation of logical expressions, allowing the creation of conditional statements and loops.

4.Assignment Operations:
The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable. Other assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /= combine an operation with assignment.

5.Increment and Decrement Operations:
Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. They are commonly used in loops and other control structures.

6.String Operations:
JavaScript uses the + operator for string concatenation, allowing the combination of multiple strings into a single string.

7.Bitwise Operations:
Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>) perform operations on the binary representation of integers. These are often used in low-level programming and manipulation of binary data.

8.Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
The ternary operator (condition ? expr1 : expr2) is a shorthand for an if-else statement. It provides a concise way to make decisions based on a condition.
