The Git workflow involves three main components: the working directory, the staging area (index), and the repository. Understanding how these components interact is essential for effectively using Git to manage version control in a project.

Working Directory:

The working directory is the folder on your local machine where you are actively making changes to your files. It contains the actual files of your project. When you start working on a project, you typically clone a repository from a remote server (e.g., GitHub), creating a working directory on your local machine.
Staging Area (Index):

The staging area, also known as the index, is a middle stage between the working directory and the Git repository. It acts as a holding area where you can select and organize changes before they are committed to the repository. Not all changes in the working directory are automatically committed; instead, you choose which changes to include in the next commit by staging them.
Repository:

The repository is where Git permanently stores the history of your project, including all the changes made over time. It consists of a hidden directory named .git at the root of your project. The repository holds metadata, such as commit objects, which contain pointers to snapshots of your project at different points in time.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the typical Git workflow:

1. Initialize a Repository:
   git init :If you're starting a new project, you'll use this command to initialize a new Git repository in your project's root directory.

2.Add Files to the Staging Area:
  git add <filename>

3.Commit Changes to the Repository:
  git commit -m "Commit message"

4.View the Commit History:
  git log

5.Working with Remote Repositories (Optional):
If you're collaborating with others or using a remote repository service (e.g., GitHub), you'll interact with remote repositories using commands like git push and git pull to share your changes and synchronize with the latest updates.
